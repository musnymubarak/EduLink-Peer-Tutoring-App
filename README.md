# EduLink-Peer-Tutoring-App
The University Peer Tutoring Platform is a web app connecting students for peer tutoring within the same university. It allows students to book sessions with subject- specific tutors, integrating with the course catalogue and real-time scheduling for easy session management. Currently focused on university use, it has potential for broader educational deployment

Peer-to-peer tutoring within academic institutions is a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the current online tutoring platforms like PeerTutors.com and Wyzant, which primarily focus on professional tutoring. Peer tutoring has been shown to be an effective learning strategy, offering students individualized support from their peers. Universities are investigating digital platforms to facilitate peer learning in response to the growing demand for flexible and accessible learning solutions[Project Proposal Group XI.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17882218/Project.Proposal.Group.XI.docx)
